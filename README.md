### 🤔 Available quests

Rolling for quests will happen automatically. 

1. All players will receive a `Quest Tracker` item.
1. Once a quest is rolled, you'll see a message pop up on top of your character detailing your quest.
1. This message will update every 10 in-game minutes with your progress.
1. Complete your quest and earn experience on a random skill. Fail, and your character will be killed.
